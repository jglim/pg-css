Custom CSS userstyle to lighten up Paul Graham's essay pages

I tend to spend quite a while reading Paul Graham's essays, however I find the text visually dense and the left-align makes reading on a widescreen display quite difficult. 
This style lightens up the font density, expands the text container, and centers the text.

Works on Firefox with [Stylish 1.3.1](http://userstyles.org/)
